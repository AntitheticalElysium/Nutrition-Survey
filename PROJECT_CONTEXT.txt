Here are the instructions for the project:

1. We are refactoring this program, please look through the README and scan all of the files in the repo. We have replaced the old survey format with a new one and need to update
the program to use the new format.

2. The new format is defined in data/survey_1.numbers. It is roughly the same but the columns have been renamed and some of the data has been changed. 

3. We now also have two new files in data/reference that contain the reference data for men and women. A new data point has also been added to the survey, containing the sex of the 
person taking the survey.

4. The instructions are simple, you need to refactor the code to use the new survey format and the new reference data files. First, we need to calculate the quantity of food eaten by the person, using the frequency columns and the quantity columns (1, 2, 3). Then, we want to calculate the DAILY (previously was weekly) consumption of each food and then use the data/nutrition_data file to find the nutritional values for each food. 

5. Finally, we need to create a copy of the relevant man/woman reference file and move it to results/, we will fill it out "valeures obtenues" column next to the reference data, and also fill out the next column with the percentage of difference between the survey taker's consumption and the reference data. This will be our final output and we will perform this for each survey in surveys/.

6. I will add some data to the test survey file, use this to test your code.
